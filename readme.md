## 0. Context
Just writing a few ideas to start getting acquainted with crypto data.

## 1. List interesting datasources

- https://glassnode.com
- https://marketcipher.trade
- https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/
- https://decentrader.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/
- https://www.lookintobitcoin.com
- https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal
- https://www.coingecko.com/en/api

## 2. Evaluate datasources
Evaluate datasources on the different features offered through API.
Decide which datasources should be tested first - generate a rank?

|Datasource|Paid/Free?|Metrics Summary|Data Latency|Granularity|Historical Data Available| Other?|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

## 2. Test selected dataSources
Test a few datasources api just to check if data is fed properly.
Get a sample of data and generate summary statistics to assert data is ok!

## 3. Build a rough simple dataset
Design a very simple dataset that can support a [DCA strategy simulation](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/crypto-dca).

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Start getting a feel on the data. List a few questions to start with.

## 4. Simulate DCA Strategy
Through simple parameters implement a simple buy & hold DCA strategy program simulator:
- acquisition date
- investment amount
- return period
